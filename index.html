            <p>Web development, also known as website development, refers to the tasks associated with creating,
                building, and maintaining websites and web applications that run online on a browser. It may, however,
                also include web design, web programming, and database management. Web development is closely related to
                the job of designing the features and functionality of apps (web design). The term development is
                usually reserved for the actual construction of these things (that is to say, the programming of sites).
                The basic tools involved in web development are programming languages called HTML (Hypertext Markup
                Language), CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), and JavaScript. There are, however, a number of other programs
                used to “manage” or facilitate the construction of sites that would otherwise have to be done “from
                scratch” by writing code. A number of content management systems (CMS) fall into this category,
                including WordPress, Joomla!, Drupal, TYPO3, and Adobe Experience Manager, among others.<br /> Web
                development is closely related to the job of designing the features and functionality of websites and
                apps (often called “web design”), but the “web development” term is usually reserved for the actual
                construction and programming of websites and apps. Think of all the web pages you have used over the
                years – Web Developers built those sites, making sure they functioned properly and performed in ways
                that allowed for a great user experience. Web Developers do this by writing lines of code, using a
                variety of programming languages, which vary depending on the tasks they are performing and the
                platforms they are working on.<br /> Front-end development involves the “client-facing” side of web
                development. That is to say usually, front-end web development refers to the portion of the site, app,
                or digital product that users will see and interact with. A Front-End Developer, therefore, is
                responsible for the way a digital product looks and “feels,” which is why they are often also referred
                to as Web Designers. Front-End Web Developers focus on translating website design and visual ideas into
                code. A front-end Software Developer takes the design ideas created by others on web development teams
                and programs them into reality, acting as a bridge between design and technology. Front-End Developers
                will usually need to possess a solid understanding of programming languages, including HTML, CSS, and
                JavaScript, as well as frameworks like React, Bootstrap, Backbone, AngularJS, and EmberJS.
                Responsibilities of a Front-End Developer would include creating responsive websites (that look and
                function well on any device), conducting website testing and fixing any bugs detected along the web
                development process, and ensuring site structure follows SEO best practices. <br><br></p>
